                <p>Hello! My name is Fatih Ersoy. I am from Turkey. I was born in Yozgat, it is a small city in the middle of Turkey, and I studied my first, secondary and high school in this city. I studied my University in University of Erciyes which is in the city of Kayseri. I have graduated from Turkish Language and Literature Department in February, 2012. I love literature but not more than science and technology. I was regretful my whole college life because of choosing a department that I never thought about in my childhood. I was dreaming to be a computer-science engineer all the time but could not succeeded.</p>
                <p>Now, I am here in America since March, 2013. And I would like to make my dreams come true. To be a web developer is going to make me feel amazing. Currently, I am a teacher in a Charter Public School and I teach my second language, Turkish. I will make my dreams come true and for that I will do whatever needed. I am someone determined when it comes to do something I want to do. I speak three languages and would like to learn some more. After finishing this course, I am planning to learn another language. I love to learn new things and love to share them with others. I love all kind of sprots, especially soccer and swimming. I like to travel. It is one of my favorite when I have a long break. </p>
